FORMAT
Coma delimited Parameter file for EcospaceConsole.
Lines that do not start with a recognised TAG will be ignored.
Recognized TAG's need to be braced with a closing and opening angle brackets
If an expected TAG is not found, it was missing or there is a typo, the varible will be left at the database value and a waring will be written to the console window.
The first three columns contain data in the format, TAG, Value, Variable Type, comments can be added in the forth column.

-----Inputs model and spatail temporal config-----
<EWE_MODEL_FILE>, data\GIST\Automated_Calibration.eweaccdb, System.String, may need to add your own directory
<SPATIAL_CONFIG_FILE>, data\GIST\STConfig.xml, System.String, may need to add your own directory

-----Scenarios and Ecospace run type-----
<MODEL_RUN_TYPE>, 1, System.Int32, Type of run 1 is a normal Ecospace Run, 2 is NGOMEX scenarios, 3 is Ecospace MonteCarlo
<ECOSIM_SCENARIO_INDEX>, 1, System.Int32
<ECOSPACE_SCENARIO_INDEX>, 1, System.Int32
<SPATIAL_ENABLED>, False, System.Boolean, Use the spatial temporal framework
<ECOSPACE_USE_IBM>, False, System.Boolean
<ECOSPACE_USE_MULTISTANZA>, True, System.Boolean
<N_ECOSPACE_TIMESTEPS_YEAR>, 12, System.Int32
<ECOSPACE_USE_SPINUP>, True, System.Boolean
<ECOSPACE_SPINUP_LENGTH>, 3, System.Int32
<N_ECOSPACE_YEARS>, 37, System.Int32, Run length in years

-----Output and saving-----
<ECOSPACE_USE_CORE_OUPUT_DIR>, False, System.Boolean
<ECOSPACE_OUTPUT_DIR>, results, System.String, may need to add your own directory
<ECOSPACE_USE_ANNUAL_OUTPUT>, True, System.Boolean, Output monthly maps and spatially averaged .csv files
<ECOSPACE_SAVE_AVERAGED_BIOMASS>, True, System.Boolean, Save the spatially averaged biomass .csv file (time series)
<ECOSPACE_SAVE_MAP_BIOMASS>, False, System.Boolean
<MO_SAVE_MAP_BIOMASS>, False, System.Boolean
<ECOSPACE_FIRST_OUTPUT_TIMESTEP>, 1, System.Int32
<ECOSPACE_SAVE_THREAD_LOG>,False, System.Boolean, Save the thread timing log in the same directory as the model. This will be the model name with _log_ThreadTiming.txt appended

-----Threads-----
<N_BIOMASS_THREADS>, 8, System.Int32, number of thread to run trophic model on
<N_GRID_THREADS>, 8, System.Int32, number of thread to run movement on
<N_EFFORT_DIST_THREADS>, 8, System.Int32, number of thread to run fishing effort distribution on
<N_IBM_MOVEMENT_THREADS>, 8, System.Int32, number of threads to run IBM movement on. This will default to the number of cores on the system.

-----Vulnerabilities-----
ECOSIM_VULNERABILITIES_BY_PRED Sets the vulnerability multiplier for a predator/column in the vulnerabilities grid. 
Format Predator_group_index vulnerability e.g. 1 999 would set all the vulnerabilities for predator group 1 to 999
Can be use to clear out existing vulnerabilities before setting individual values by prey pred index

ECOSIM_VULNERABILITIES_BY_PREY_PRED Sets vulnerabilities for a single prey and predator, prey index first 
Format prey index first then predator then vulnerability  e.g. 10 1 999 would set the vulnerabilities of group 10 to predator group 1 to 999

//example <ECOSIM_VULNERABILITIES_BY_PRED>,1 999, System.Single[]
//example <ECOSIM_VULNERABILITIES_BY_PREY_PRED>,1 2 666 1 8 666 1 9 666 1 10 666 1 11 666 1 12 666 1 13 666 1 14 666, System.Single[]

-----Dispersal-----
ECOSPACE_DISPERSAL_RATE array of dispersal rates in group order. There is no group index, it assumes they are in the same order as the groups. 
If the array has fewer values than the groups it will just set the dispersal rates for part of the groups.

//example <ECOSPACE_DISPERSAL_RATE>,1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000, System.Single[]

-----Environmental Responses-----
Environmental response shapes format  eShapeFunctionType 1-11, Shape index from the Ecospace environmental responses interface, Function parameters from the Change Shape dialogue(in the same order as they appear in the UI grid)
//<ECOSPACE_ENVIRONMENTAL_RESPONSE_STRING>, 1 223 1 1 | 1 224 0 0 |  1 225 1 1 | 11 226 0.00001 1000000 50000 50 , System.String[]
